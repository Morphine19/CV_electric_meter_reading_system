# CV_electric_meter_reading_system

## Introduction

  This repo contributes to show the process and step by step on my approach to an automated meter reading system for my Final Year Project.The project is titled "IOT BASED MONITORING SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE SINGLE-PHASE ELECTRICAL METERS" . As mentioned the repo will include the step by step guide so you can also install the system on your single board computer in my case it will be Raspberry pi 3B. Also with every step i will also include a simple video where i demonstrate the tassk as a my proof of progress.
