# CV_electric_meter_reading_system

## Introduction

This repo contributes to show the process and step by step on my approach to an automated meter reading system for my Final Year Project.The project is titled "IOT BASED MONITORING SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE SINGLE-PHASE ELECTRICAL METERS" . As mentioned the repo will include the step by step guide so you can also install the system on your single board computer in my case it will be Raspberry pi 3B. Also with every step i will also include a simple video where i demonstrate the task as a my proof of progress.
  
## Flowchart

The Following is the flowchart that ill be using for Iot System, the system is divided to several steps which can see on the image below :
  
  *final flowchart image goes here*
  
As we can see the final flowchart is developed,but this is not the first iteration of the flowchart is a bit diffrent we can it from the image below, tht the unrevised version of the flowchart has a step where we implemented YOLO algorithm to the system but due to the limitation of the project it is concluded that it is better to design the system for a specific single phase electrical meter which is the MSI-200 which is own by the PLN(*pembangkit listrik negara*).This type of meter is really common isntalled among the household in Indonesia.

## Methodology

The Methodology is the part where i show you my progress the system for your own single board compute. I divided the step into 10 steps :

1. install raspbian OS
2. installing OpenCV
3. Accesing the webcam Via OpenCV operators
4. Hardware setup
5. Camera input from the device
6. ROI cropping
7. Preprocessing
8. Tesseract installation and configuration
9. Installing Influxdb
10. Incoperating influxdb with the system 

without further ado lets get started
